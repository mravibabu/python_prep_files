CPython is not the fastest. PyPy is an alternate Python implementation that is both compliant and fast. PyPy depends on just-in-time (JIT) compilation that dramatically reduces the execution time for long-running operations.
In this tutorial, PyPy will be introduced for beginners to highlight how it is different from CPython.
PyPy supports hundreds of Python libraries, including NumPy.
