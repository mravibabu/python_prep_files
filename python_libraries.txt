Introduction of libraries in python
arrow -->working with dates and times
Bokeh--> interactive visualisation of data , html and javascripts
Beutiful Soap -->parsing libraries and parsing data from html
cirq--> creating noisy intermediate scale quantum circuits to reveal the components of the circuits.
Django--> DataAnalysis and processing of data
Eli5--> Mathametical computation  in short times
FlashText--> search and replacement of words in given data
		input is setof words or string
Keras -->Machine learning or data mining
		implement the concept of regression , clustring etc.
Matplotlib--> charts graphs pie charts scatterplots histograms etc
				for data visualisation
Mahota--> image processing libraries
Numpy--> Most of the libraries use this numpy internally.
	    numverical python and arrays
nltk--> natural language processing tool kit
networkx--> creating or working of complex networls
openCV--> open source computer vision
			this also completely meant for image processing
pandas--> main use is data analysis. re-indexing,sorting ,iterative,concatination like applications etc
pytorch--> used for machine learning algorithm as well as deep learning
pygame-->writing vedio games, consists of computer graphics softwares
requests--> creating http request, responsively and user friendly.
scikit learn--> machine learning
scikit image --> image processing
scipy--> scientific python--statistics algebra  integration
seaaborn  --> data visualisation libraries, high level 	 nteractive and informative
sympy  ---> symbolic computations
sqlalchemy--> communication btwn python and database
tensorflow--> machine learning library to compute tensor operations
		representing data in n dimensional matrices
theano--> machine learning  similar to tensor flow but not efficient then tensor flow
	it can be implimented  	in both parallel and distribuated environment
textblob-->textual language procession , tokenization ie the dividing complete string or sentence into simple parts
pillow--> PIL (ython image library) it is also meant for image manupulation support format BMP,PDF,JPEG,GIF etc. image filters.
wxpython--> for gui applications.
web2py--> used to create dynamic web development content
