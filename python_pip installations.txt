Pyflakes
A simple program which checks Python source files for errors.

Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors. It works by parsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on modules with side effects. It's also much faster.

It is available on PyPI and it supports all active versions of Python: 2.7 and 3.4 to 3.8.



Useful tips:

Be sure to install it for a version of Python which is compatible with your codebase: for Python 2, pip2 install pyflakes and for Python3, pip3 install pyflakes.
You can also invoke Pyflakes with python3 -m pyflakes . or python2 -m pyflakes . if you have it installed for both versions.
If you require more options and more flexibility, you could give a look to Flake8 too.
