you will have to face criticism about one or more of the following points but not limited to:

Bad coding
Not following standard
Not keeping performance in mind
History, Indentation, Comments are not appropriate.
Readability is poor
Open files are not closed
Allocated memory has not been released
Too many global variables.
Too much hard coding.
Poor error handling.
No modularity.
Repeated code.

Once you are done with your coding, go for a self-review atleast once. I'm sure, a self-review would help you in removing 90% problems yourself.

Once you are completely done with your coding and self review, request your peer for a code review.
