What if you don’t create any primary key yourself?
It’s not mandatory to create a primary key yourself. If you have not defined any primary key, InnoDB implicitly creates one for you because InnoDB by design must have a primary key in every table. So once you create a primary key later on for that table, InnoDB deletes the previously auto defined primary key.
SHOW EXTENDED INDEX FROM index_demo;
EXTENDED shows all the indices that are not usable by the user but managed completely by MySQL.
ALTER TABLE index_demo ADD PRIMARY KEY (phone_no);
SHOW INDEXES FROM index_demo;
