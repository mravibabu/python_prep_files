Q1. What is Python?
Ans.  Python is a highly readable object-oriented programming language with automatic memory management. It is the language that can be written with English keywords, while other languages use punctuations.
Python is easy to learn, portable and it is open-source. It is designed to solve simple as well as complicated operations. It also supports multiple languages such as C, C++, and Java.
Q2. Explain the key features of Python?
Ans.  Following are multiple features that make python different from other languages:
Easy to learn: Python is a programmer-friendly language that it is easy to learn in just a few days. It uses fewer keywords as compared to other object-oriented languages and anyone can learn it
Object-oriented: Python is both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming language. In procedure-oriented languages, procedures can be used again. Python allows developers to use an object-oriented approach to develop applications.
Open-source and free: Python is an Open-source language that means anyone can easily access the programming and development. There is an open forum online where the number of coders contributes to improving this language.
High-level language: Python is defined as a high-level language because of this feature. You do not need to keep an eye on programming structure, memory management, and architecture of the code.
Extendable & Scalable: Python is extendable as it can be extended by using different modules to its interpreters. It helps developers to modify the program. It also provides scalability to the large codes by providing support and good structure to it.
Q3. What is PEP 8?
Ans.  PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal) is a Python guide used for the formatting of Python code. It helps to increase the readability and provide the functionality to the source code.
Q4. Why is python different from other scripting languages?
Ans.  Python is different from other programming languages in many ways:
Python is easy to read and write
It is free. Users can easily share, copy, and edit it.
It can be used with multiple platforms, so the programmers do not have the platform issue.
It is an object-oriented programming language and a piece of programming code can be reusable.
Q5. Explain memory management in Python.
Ans.  In Python, memory management has different components that are allocated to do various tasks like sharing, caching, and segmentation. Python memory is managed by a private heap space. It also has a garbage collector that removes unwanted memory and free the heap space.

Q6. What is pickling and unpickling?
Ans.  Pickling: It is the process in which objects are serialized and unserialized before it can be saved to the disk. It converts python objects into byte codes.
Unpickling: Unpickling is opposite to pickling as it converts byte code into python objects.
Q7. What are the modules in Python? Name some built-in modules in Python?
Ans.  Python modules are the files that contain Python statement and definitions such as –
E.g., demo.py
Here, the module name is “demo.”
Python modules are used to break the large program into small segments that make the code manageable and organized.
Q8. What are the basic data types in Python?
Ans.  There are five basic data types in Python:
Numbers
String
List
Tuple
Dictionary
Q9. Mention the use of tuple in Python?
Ans.  Tuple is a data type similar to a list. It is used in programs to group the related data equivalent to the directory.
Example:
list_val = [5, 4, 3, 2]
tup_val = (5, 4, 3, 2)
print(list_val)
print(tup_val)
Output:
[5, 4, 3, 2]
(5, 4, 3, 2)
Q10. Explain local variables and global variables in Python.
Ans.  Global variables are declared outside the function and it can be used both inside and outside the function. It has a global scope.
Local variables are those which are declared inside the function or in the local scope which cannot be used outside the function.
Example:
A combination of global and local variable declaration
def foo(x, y):
global a
a = 62
x,y = y,x
b = 22
b = 15
c = 100
print(a,b,x,y)
a, b, x, y = 1, 15, 2,3
foo(17, 3)
print(a, b, x, y)
Output:
62 15 3 15
22 15 2 3
Q11. What is the difference between Python Arrays and Lists?
Ans.  Lists and arrays both are used to store data, but the difference is that the List can any hold any data type while arrays can hold a single data type.
Example:
import array as arr
My_Array=arr.array(‘i’,[4,3,2,1])
My_list=[5,’abc’,1.20]
print(My_Array)
print(My_list)
Output:
array(‘i’, [4, 3, 2, 1])
[5, ‘abc’, 1.2]
Q12. What is lambda in Python?
Ans.   Lambda is a keyword used to declare any function and that function is called lambda function. It is a simple function listed as an argument.
Example:
# Python code to illustrate square of a number
# showing difference between def() and lambda().
def square(a):
return a*a;
g = lambda b: b*b
print(g(3))
print(square(5))
Output:
9
25
Q13. Briefly explain Functions in Python?
Ans.   Functions are the small segment of code, which are reusable codes used to perform actions when it is called. “def” keyword is used to define any function in Python.
Example:
def printstar( q ):
“This prints a passed string into this function”
print q
Return
Q14. Is Python an Interpreted or a Compiled language?
Ans.  Python is an interpreted language. It converts the source code that is written by the programmer into an intermediate language, which is again translated into machine language before being executed.
Q15. Name the supported data types in Python?

Test runner
Example:
import unittest
class ABC(unittest.TestCase):
def xyz():
…
if __name__ == “__main__”:
unittest.main()
Q25. What is a negative index in Python?
Ans.  Python sequences can be indexed as positive and negative numbers. A negative index accesses elements from the end of the list counting backward.
Q26. What is the difference between Xrange() and range()?
Ans.  Range() returns a list and Xrange() returns an Xrange object, which is kind of like an iterator and generates the numbers on demand.
Q27. Define module and package.
Ans.  A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.
A Python package is simply a directory of Python module(s).
Q28. Why don’t lambda forms have statements?
Ans.  It is because a lambda form is used to make a new function object and then return at runtime. Also, the syntactic framework of Python is unable to handle statements nested inside expressions.

Q49. Which python library is used for Machine learning?
Ans.  Scikit-learn python Library is used for Machine learning.
Q50. What is the role of len() in python?
Ans.  len() is used to determine the length of an array, list and string in the program.
Example:
str1=’1234’
len(str1)
Q51. What is the output of the following code?
class Demo:
def __initl__(self, id):
self.id = id
id = 777
acc = Acc(222)
print acc.id
Ans.  Output: 222
Reason: “Demo” class automatically calls the method ”initl” and passes the object and “222” is assigned to the object called id. So, the value “777” cannot be called and the output will be “222”.
Q52. How to delete a file in Python?
Ans.  OS Module needs to be installed to delete any file in python. After installing the module, os.remove() function is used to delete a file.
Q53. Write a code to test whether the number is in the defined range or not?
Ans.
def test_range(n1):
if n1 in range(0, 555):
print(”%s is in range”%str(n1))
else:
print(”%s is not in range”%str(n1))
Output:
test_range(555)
555 is not in the range
Q54. Write a code to convert a string into lowercase?
Ans.  lower() is used to convert the string into lower case
str=’XYZ’
print(str.lower())
Output: xyz
Q55. What is the output of the following code?
nameList = [‘Joe’, ‘Nick’, ‘Bob’, ‘Harry’]
print nameList[1][-1]
Ans.  Output:
k
Reason: [-1] shows the last element or character of the string. In the above code, ]1] represents the second string and [-1] represents the last character of the second string, i.e., “k.”
Q56. Which databases are supported by Python?
Ans.  MySQL (Structured) and MongoDB (Unstructured) are supported by Python. First, the modules should be imported to the library to interact with the database.
Q57. What is the output of the following code?
demoCodes = [1, 2, 3, 4]
demoCodes.append([5,6,7,8])
print len(demoCodes)
Ans.  Output: 5
Reason: ‘append’ method is used in the code, which has to append the existing object into the list. But the append method does not merge the list, which is added as an element. So, the output will be’5’.
Q58. What is the use of the ‘#’ symbol in Python?
Ans.  ‘#’ symbol is used to symbolize the comments
print (“I am a quick learner”)
#print (“I am a quick learner”)
Q59. Suppose a list1 is [2, 44, 191, 86], what would be the output for list1[-1]

print(x.split())
Output:  [‘Naukri’, ‘python’]
Q68. How to create classes in Python? 
Ans. In Python, classes are user-defined which is defined with a class keyword
Example:
Class Student:
def_init_(self, name) :
self.name = name
S1 = Student (“xyz”)
print (S1.name)
Output: xyz
Q69. How do we create an empty class in Python?
Ans. An empty class in Python is the blank class that does not have any code defined within its block. We can create an empty class using the pass keyword. 
Example:
Class x:
&nbsp: pass
obj=x()
obj.name=”xyz”
print (“Name = “,obj.name)
Output: 
Name = xyz
Q70. Write a program in Python to check if a sequence is a Palindrome.
Ans. To check a sequence whether it is palindrome or not:
x=input (“enter sequence”)
y=x[::-1]

else:
&nbsp; print (“Not a Palindrome”)
Output:
enter sequence 323 Palindrome
Q71. Mention the differences between Django, Pyramid, and Flask?
Ans. Following are the difference between Django, Pyramid, and Flask:
Flask is used to create small applications with simpler necessities. It requires external libraries to built applications, and you are ready to use it.
The Pyramid is used to create large applications. It is heavy configurable and requires a database, templating style, URL structure, and other elements to build an application. It also provides flexibility to choose the right tools for development.
Django is also used for large applications that is similar to the Pyramid. It consists of an ORM.
Q72. Explain the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?
Ans. Shallow copy is used at the time of new instance creation, and it stores the copied values whereas in deep copy, the copying process executes in looping, and copy of an object is copied in other object. A shallow copy has faster program execution than a deep copy.
Q73. Which statement can we use in Python if the statement is required syntactically, but no action is needed for the program?
Ans. Pass statement is used if the statement is required syntactically, but no action is required for the program
Example:
If(x>20)
print(“Naukri”)
else
pass
Q74. What are the tools required to unit test your Python code?
Ans. To test units or classes, we can use the “unittest” python standard library. It is the easiest way to test code, and features required are similar to the other unit testing tools like TestNG, JUnit.
Q75. How to get indices of N maximum values in a NumPy array?
Ans. With the help of below code, we can get the  N maximum values in a NumPy array :
